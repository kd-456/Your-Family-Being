# Your Family Being 
We made an application prototype using Figma and Miroboard.Occasionally,it happens that even after proper consultation with doctor or want to check about their symptoms online if they are too mild to prevent the”unnecessary” consulting fees.Sometimes the patients are unable to manage all the medical requirements that are needed to be taken care of  for proper recovery and sometime, it become difficult to select a specialist for the particular illness due to less awarness regarding different consultants. The problem of forgetting the medical schedule (taking medicine on time, consuming proper diet ) is common among middle aged  and old people. So,we reflected on this problem and want to contribute something that can help to overcome this obstacle.

Your Family Being will designed to assist users in managing their health more effectively, especially for those who find it challenging to keep track of medical schedules, symptoms, and doctor consultations. This app aims to provide a comprehensive solution to bridge the gap between patient needs and medical care.


## Future Plans
The next step is to develop an app based on this application prototype.
